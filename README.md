# OOP_Pong_Game
Honing my OOP skills through creating the classic game Pong

## How to play
Two people can play or you can play by yourself ðŸ¥‡
One player uses "W" and "S" to move the bat up and down respectively and the other other player uses the UP and DOWN arrow keys.
The aim of the game is to prevent the ball from going past you.

Be careful! The speed of the ball gets faster with each succesful bat!
